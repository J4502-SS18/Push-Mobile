        At Push Mobile, our mission is radical transparency. On the development side, it's why we're open source and why we're open to having others add new features to our app.
        But we also want help news organizations who use our app to promote radical transparency in the governments and communities they cover
      </p>

      <p>This is why the Push Mobile ecosystem is designed to help small news organizations in countries where the government is hostile to journalists and media outlets.
      The Push Mobile server, which funnels content directly from the CMS to the mobile app, has the ability to use a VPN to prevent content censorship. It also uses HTTPS to ensure completely encrypted communications.</p>
