		<p>Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.
To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more?
Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.
It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.

			<p> We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.
As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.
For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!
When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!</p>

			<p> Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.
Failure is not an option.
Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

			<p> Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.
Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.
Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</p>
